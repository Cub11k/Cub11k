### Hi GithubðŸ‘‹!

I've finished two years of Bachelor's program in applied maths and computer science at Lomonosov MSU, which was abruptly interrupted in 2022 due to the war and cancer.
I'm now studying Computer Sciense at Bar Ilan University, I love programming and am willing to start my career in Israeli HighTech.
