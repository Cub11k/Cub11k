### Hi GithubðŸ‘‹!

I've finished two years of Bachelor's program in applied maths and computer science at Lomonosov MSU, which was abruptly interrupted in 2022 due to the war and cancer.
I love programming, currently work in a startup in the field of automated social networks management and willing to start my career in Israeli HighTech.
